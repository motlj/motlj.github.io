  <h2>Now, this is a story all about how my <em class="tacobox">Tacos</em> got flipped-turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a site about tacos.</h2>

      <p title="How Tacos Tacos Tacos became more than just a dream." class="mayan center">It was a blustery winter evening late in December 2015. Alaska in the winter time can be a beautiful place. However, this was not the case for the founder of <em class="tacobox">Tacos Tacos Tacos</em>. Enter Cornelious Oswald. Cornelious had just finished a long day at the office, getting told by 7 bosses to do the same job 7 different ways and at 7 different speeds. He had had just about all he could take. When Cornelious got home from work that night he opened his fridge to look for dinner ideas. "Burgers?" Cornelious asked himself. "No, how about Chicken Alfredo?" his subconscious retorted. Cornelious went back and forth with himself for some time. Nothing quite sounded good enough. Until it hit him. <em class="tacobox">"TACOS!"</em> he shouted. The rest as they say is history</p>
      <hr>
      <p title="How Tacos Tacos Tacos became more than just a dream." class="mayan center">Well, that history does indeed have a story. If you'd like to know it, read on. Cornelious ended up making way to many <em class="tacobox">Tacos</em> that night. In an effort to get rid of them, he shared them with all of his neighbors. Lucky for Cornelious, only 3 people that he shared with got food poisoning. The other person loved them. That was all the reinforcement he needed. The next day he walked right into his office and placed a plated <em class="tacobox">taco</em> on each of his 7 bosses desks. On the plate he wrote a message in <em class="tacobox">taco</em> sauce that read "I quit, and I don't want to <em class="tacobox">taco</em> 'bout it."</p>
      <hr>
      <p title="How Tacos Tacos Tacos became more than just a dream." class="mayan center">From that point on, it was <em class="tacobox">Tacos</em> all the time. Cornelious has dedicated every waking minute trying to make the perfect <em class="tacobox">taco</em>. Different meats, seasonings, toppings, sauces. You name it, Cornelious has tried it. Sometimes they haven't turned out the greatest. Take the Chocolate Pudding and meatloaf <em class="tacobox">taco</em> in a spinach tortilla. YUCK! But he's never given up. Even though his business has driven him into crippling debt and took his house, he won't quit. When his wife left him, do you think he quit? Absolutely not. He made a <em class="tacobox">taco</em> out of his very own tears and delivered it to her. She said it was salty and threw it at him. Heart-broken and lonely, Cornelious really focused on his craft. But every <em class="tacobox">taco</em> he made seemed to get worse and worse. With no money, no house and no family, Cornelious was ready to throw in the towel and become a pirate, sailing the world in a quest for buried treasure.</p>
      <hr>
      <p title="How Tacos Tacos Tacos became more than just a dream." class="mayan center">Then one day, it clicked. And Cornelious created <em class="tacobox">Tacos Tacos Tacos</em> Most Boring <em class="tacobox">Taco</em> in the World <small>&reg;</small>. He had finally created a taco that was edible enough to eat without projectile vomiting. Success has never tasted so mediocre. His wife caught wind of the new <em class="tacobox">taco</em> and came running back to him. The bank forgave all of his loans and even gave him his house back. This was great news, as Cornelious was not cut out to be a pirate. Cornelious suffers from extreme seasickness. He also is deathly afraid of water and of being killed by a sword. Instead, Cornelious went on to create numerous amazing <em class="tacobox">tacos</em>. World renowned even. Some critics have said that there isn't a rating high enough for <em class="tacobox">Tacos Tacos Tacos</em>. Turns out all it took was one incredibly boring <em class="tacobox">taco</em> to make Cornelious' dreams come true.</p>
      <p class="mayan">Becoming a Pirate, Cornelious? I don't think so. Better stick to something you're good at, like <em class="tacobox">Tacos</em>!</p>

      <p title="Meet Cornelious Oswald" class="mayan center">Cornelious Oswald was born on March 9th, 1978 on the small island of Adak, Alaska. Cornelious was the youngest of 14 children. Often forgot about at dinnertime, Cornelious had to come up with a way to feed himself. This is where his love of <em class="tacobox">tacos</em> originated. Today, Cornelious owns the island of Adak, Alaska and has given jobs at <em class="tacobox">Tacos Tacos Tacos</em> to all 326 of its residents. He is locally referred to as <em class="tacobox">King Taco</em>.</p>
