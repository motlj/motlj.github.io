	{"postDate":"April 9th, 2016", "postTitle":"Creation of Blog", "postContent":"This is my first blog post. I've never blogged before so I'm not really sure what I should be posting. Today, I'm working on creating the blog page for my GitHub Portfolio. It uses AJAX to select and display blog posts from a JSON file. Once I have that all working I hope to clean up my CSS. I really struggle with CSS as I'm a fan of very bright colors, which tend to make websites look a tad childish. I hope to find a happy medium that allows me to use the bright colors that I enjoy while also maintaining a level of professionalism. Much easier said than done. Wish me luck.", "postAuthor":"Joshua Motl"},
	{"postDate":"April 9th, 2016", "postTitle":"Blast into the Past", "postContent":"While today is actually April 9th, this post is about the events that took place on April 8th. On that day, my site started to really take shape. I set up my folder structure and then began to add some content to the pages. I started by adding a carousel banner and navbar from bootstrap to my index. I then added a projects page and included my ecommerce project. MY next step was to begin planning out my styles.", "postAuthor":"Joshua Motl"},
	{"postDate":"April 10th, 2016", "postTitle":"Future Post", "postContent":"Today, I finalzed my styles for the entire site. I cleaned up the images and added SEO. SEO is important to add so that a website can be easily found through search engines. It helps increase traffic to your site. After adding the SEO I verified that the functionality of the entire site was working properly.", "postAuthor":"Joshua Motl"},
	{"postDate":"April 19th, 2016", "postTitle":"Undestanding 'This'", "postContent":"I recently read 'Understand JavaScript’s “this” With Clarity, and Master It' from the javascriptissexy.com blog. This article explained all about 'this' in javascript functions. We use 'this' almost like a pronoun is used in the English language. 'This' is a shortcut or referant to an object. I read this article as an assignment, but am very glad that I did because it was extremely informative.", "postAuthor":"Joshua Motl"},
	{"postDate":"April 19th, 2016", "postTitle":"Declarations VS Expressions", "postContent":"I recently read 'Function Declaration vs. Function Expressions' on javascriptweblog.wordpress.com. This article explained the differences between Function Declarations and Expressions. A Function Declaration defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. Function Declarations occur as standalone constructs and cannot be nested within non-function blocks. A Function Expression defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a variable assignment ). Functions defined via Functions Expressions can be named or anonymous. I read this article to further my knowledge of javascript and to fully comprehend this subject.", "postAuthor":"Joshua Motl"}
