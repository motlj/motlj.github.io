								<p class="paraTwo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fun, I like to watch a lot of sports. My favorites are the obvious - Packers, Brewers and Bucks, in that order. When I'm not watching sports (sometimes while I am watching sports) I like to cook. I used to cook and a couple restaurants throughout Milwaukee. It is something I enjoy a lot, but only as a hobby - not as a profession.</p>
