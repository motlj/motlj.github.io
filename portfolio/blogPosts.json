Today, I'm working on creating the blog page for my GitHub Portfolio. It uses AJAX to select and display blog posts from a JSON file. Once I have that all working I hope to clean up my CSS. I really struggle with CSS as I'm a fan of very bright colors, which tend to make websites look a tad childish. I hope to find a happy medium that allows me to use the bright colors that I enjoy while also maintaining a level of professionalism. Much easier said than done. Wish me luck."},

On that day, my site started to really take shape. I set up my folder structure and then began to add some content to the pages. I started by adding a carousel banner and navbar from bootstrap to my index. I then added a projects page and included my ecommerce project. MY next step was to begin planning out my styles."},
	{"postDate":"April 10th, 2016", "postTitle":"Future Post", "postContent":"Today, I finalzed my styles for the entire site. I cleaned up the images and added SEO. SEO is important to add so that a website can be easily found through search engines. It helps increase traffic to your site. After adding the SEO I verified that the functionality of the entire site was working properly."},
