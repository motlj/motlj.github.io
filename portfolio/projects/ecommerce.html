		<h3>Ecommerce site | J. Marie Sign &amp; Design</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p>My first big programming assignment was to create an online store. This store needed to allow users to create accounts that stored all of their personal data that would be needed to complete an online transaction. This site also needed to have give administrators the ability to access all data and manipulate it. Both of these tasks were completed using a MySQL Database and CRUD functionality.</p>
				<p>Once the database and CRUD functionality was working properly, I needed to give users the ability to add items to cart and store them there until the user took further action (removal from cart or checkout). This meant that if a user wanted to continue shopping or left the site all together, the items would remain in their cart. Upon checkout, The user is asked to select a shipping address and credit card from the info they have stored in the database that is associated with their account.</p>
				<p>On the administrative side of the site, I needed to allow the admins access to many features that a regular user would not be able to see. These functions included updating shipments centers, product bins within those shipment centers, the categories in which the products can be found, and all of the products individual attributes (price, description, etc.).</p>
				<p>This project was built using LAMPP Stack</p>
